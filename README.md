## 🧘 No Ego

**Ego = 1 / Knowledge**  
Albert Einstein:  
“More the knowledge lesser the Ego, lesser the knowledge, more the Ego.”

---

## 🧩 No Personality  

Albert Einstein:  
“We should take care not to make the intellect our god;  
it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality.”

---

## 🌱 No Being  

---

## 🌌 No Life  

---

## 🧠 Conceptual Model

```python
import math

class Supreme_Wisdom:
    knowledge = math.inf

    def __init__(self):
        print("All things being equal = Everything happens as expected")

    def ego(self):
        return 1 / self.knowledge

    def power(self):
        return self.knowledge

    def personality(self):
        return 1 / self.power()

    def being(self):
        return 1 / self.knowledge

    def time_frame(self):
        return float(self.knowledge)

    def life(self):
        return 1 / self.time_frame()

## 明心见性 — Consciousness
Understanding the abstract “I” and nothing else.

## 📜 2021/07/20 — 回收台湾

诗曰：
欲进又徘徊，心危事不危。
水边人指引，名利得荣归。
Translation:
I wished to move forward but hesitated. The heart sensed danger, but all was actually well.
Guided by one who lives by the water, fame and fortune return in honor.

## 📜 2021/10/03 — 空既是色，色既是空

A simple analogy:

空 (Emptiness) → abstract class
色 (Form) → concrete class
相 (Appearance) → object instance

Example:
You see a cat.

The specific cat you see = object (instance)
“Cat” = abstract class
“Black cat” = concrete class

This reflects the mind moving from concrete → abstract, a verifiable cognitive method.

## 🌍 The World

The universe is a running virtual system (instance).
There may be many worlds (classes), each with multiple instances, but our universe instance is unique.
A cloned object is always a new object.
I (object) am an instance of the Human (class).
This perspective treats “I” as an object implementing the State Pattern, altering behavior as its internal state changes.

## 🌀 My Nature: An Abstract Class

The concept “I” is fundamentally abstract:

cannot use “this” → 无我
cannot instantiate → 无人
cannot inherit → 无众生
no lifecycle methods → 无寿者
---

## 🎯 The Predict Principle

With access to the underlying SDK, one could debug the system.
Parameters are pseudo‑random; identical input yields identical output.
Accurate testing must occur outside the running system.
Within the system, one cannot cleanly separate:

test data
system execution
observed results

This separation is required for any valid testing or model training.

## 🎮 Our World as a Virtual Game

Are we NPCs or Players?
Generally, we behave like NPCs within this world-instance.
External Players may exist, but their presence could appear in diverse, non‑direct forms—not limited to simple control.
